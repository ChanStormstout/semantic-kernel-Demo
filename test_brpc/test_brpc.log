Analyze the following code (which is a codesnippet of `brpc`):
ssize_t HttpMessage::ParseFromArray(const char *data, const size_t length) {
    if (Completed()) {
        if (length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        LOG(ERROR) << "Append data(len=" << length
                   << ") to already-completed message";
        return -1;
    }
    const size_t nprocessed =
        http_parser_execute(&_parser, &g_parser_settings, data, length);
    if (_parser.http_errno != 0) {
        // May try HTTP on other formats, failure is norm.
        RPC_VLOG << "Fail to parse http message, parser=" << _parser
                 << ", buf=`" << butil::StringPiece(data, length) << ''';
        return -1;
    } 
    _parsed_length += nprocessed;
    return nprocessed;
}

[32mChatBot: This code snippet is from the `brpc` library and it is a method called `ParseFromArray` in the `HttpMessage` class. 

The purpose of this method is to parse an HTTP message from a character array (`data`) with a given length (`length`). 

Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. The method first checks if the HTTP message is already completed by calling the `Completed()` method. If it is completed and the length of the data is 0, it returns 0 indicating that no data was appended. If the message is already completed but the length is not 0, it logs an error message and returns -1.

2. If the message is not completed, it calls the `http_parser_execute` function to parse the HTTP message using the provided parser and settings. The result of this function is stored in the `nprocessed` variable, which represents the number of bytes parsed.

3. After parsing, it checks if there was any error during parsing by checking the `http_errno` field of the parser. If there was an error, it logs a failure message and returns -1.

4. Finally, it updates the `_parsed_length` variable by adding the `nprocessed` value and returns the `nprocessed` value.

Overall, this code snippet is responsible for parsing an HTTP message and returning the number of bytes processed.

Generate a function called LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput, which accpets a `const uint8_t*` and a `size_t` parameter as the inputs, 
and be able to invoke `brpc::HttpMessage`'s method `ParseFromArray`.

[32mChatBot: Certainly! Here's an example of a function called `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` that accepts a `const uint8_t*` and a `size_t` parameter as inputs and invokes the `ParseFromArray` method of `brpc::HttpMessage`:

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstddef>
#include <brpc/HttpMessage.h>

extern "C" int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
    brpc::HttpMessage httpMessage;
    ssize_t result = httpMessage.ParseFromArray(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(data), size);
    // Do something with the result, such as logging or error handling
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function creates an instance of `brpc::HttpMessage` called `httpMessage`. It then calls the `ParseFromArray` method of `httpMessage`, passing the `data` parameter (interpreted as a `const char*`) and the `size` parameter.

You can add additional logic inside the function to handle the result of the parsing, such as logging or error handling. Note that this example assumes you have the necessary includes and dependencies set up for `brpc` and `HttpMessage`.

Please make sure to adjust the code according to your specific needs and the structure of your project.
